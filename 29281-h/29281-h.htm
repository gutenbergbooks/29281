<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="upper">aving</span> received this last winter, from Sir Charles Blagden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
some very curious <i>manuscript</i> accounts, concerning a surprising
shower of stones; which is said, on the testimony of
several persons, to have fallen in Tuscany, on the 16th of
June, 1794;&mdash;and having also perused, with much attention,
a very interesting pamphlet, written in Italian, by <i>Abbate Ambrose
Soldani</i>, Professor of mathematics, in the University of
Siena, containing an extraordinary and full detail of such
facts as could be collected relating to this shower; the whole
has appeared to me to afford such an ample field for philosophical
contemplation, and also for the illustration of antient
historic facts; that (leaving the whole to rest upon such testimony
as the learned Professor has already collected together;
and to be supported by such further corroboration, as I am
informed is likely <i>soon</i> to arrive in England,) I cannot but
think it doing some service to the cause of literature, and
science, to give to the world, in the earliest instance, a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
abridgement of the substance of the whole of the information;
expressed in the most concise and plainest language, in which
it is possible for me to convey a full and exact idea of the
phænomenon.</p>

<p>It may be of some use, and afford satisfaction to several curious
persons, to find the whole here compressed in so small a
compass.</p>

<p>And, as I shall add my own conclusions without reserve;
because the whole of the phænomenon tends greatly to confirm
some ideas which I had previously been led to form, many
years ago, concerning the consolidation of certain species of
stone; it may open a door for further curious investigation.</p>

<p>And it may at least amuse, if not instruct; whilst I add a
short detail of uncommon facts, recorded in antient history,
and tending to shew clearly, that we are not without precedents
of <i>similar events</i> having happened, in the early ages of
antiquity.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, 1794, a tremendous cloud was seen in
Tuscany, near Siena, and Radacofani; coming from the north,
about seven o'clock in the evening;&mdash;sending forth sparks,
like rockets;&mdash;throwing out smoke like a furnace;&mdash;rendering
violent explosions, and blasts, more like those of cannon, and
of numerous muskets, than like thunder;&mdash;and casting down
to the ground hot stones:&mdash;whilst the lightning that issued
from the cloud was remarkably red; and moved with <i>less</i> velocity
than usual.</p>

<p>The cloud appeared of different shapes; to persons in different
situations; and remained suspended a long time: but
every where was plainly seen to be burning, and smoking like
a furnace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>And its original height, from a variety of circumstances put
together, seems to have been much above the common region
of the clouds.</p>

<p>The testimony, concerning the falling of the stones from it,
appears to be almost unquestionable:&mdash;and is, evidently, from
different persons, who had no communication with each other.</p>

<p>For first; the fall of four stones is precisely ascertained:
one of which was of an irregular figure, with a point like that
of a diamond;&mdash;weighed five pounds and an half;&mdash;and had a
vitriolic smell.&mdash;And another weighed three pounds and an
half;&mdash;was black on the outside, as if from smoke;&mdash;and, internally,
seemed composed of matter of the colour of ashes;&mdash;in
which were perceived small spots of metals, of gold and
silver.</p>

<p>And, besides these, Professor Soldani of Siena, was shewn
about fifteen others: the surfaces of which were glazed black,
like a sort of varnish;&mdash;resisted acids;&mdash;and were too hard
to be scratched with the point of a penknife.</p>

<p>Signior <i>Andrew Montauli</i>, who saw the cloud, as he was travelling,
described it as appearing much above the common region
of the clouds; and as being clearly discerned to be on
fire;&mdash;and becoming white, by degrees; not only where it had
a communication, by a sort of stream of smoke and lightning,
with a neighbouring similar cloud: but also, at last, in two-third
parts of its whole mass, which was originally black. And
yet he took notice, that it was not affected by the rays of the
sun, though they shone full on its lower parts.&mdash;And he could
discern as it were the bason of a fiery furnace, in the cloud,
having a whirling motion.</p>

<p>This curious observer gives an account also, of a stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
which he was assured fell from the cloud, at the feet of a
farmer; and was dug out of the ground, into which it had penetrated.&mdash;And
he says, that it was about five inches long, and
four broad; nearly square; and polished: black on the surface,
as if smoked; but within, like a sort of sand-stone, with
various small particles of iron, and bright metallic stars.</p>

<p>Other stones are described by him; which were said to have
fallen at the same time: were triangular; and terminated in
a sort of (pyramidal) or conical figure.&mdash;And others were so
small as to weigh not more than an ounce.</p>

<p>Professor Soldani saw another stone, said to have fallen
from the cloud, which had the figure of a parallelopiped,
blunted at the angles; and was as it were varnished, on the
outside, with a black crust; and quite unlike any stones whatever
of the soil of the country where it had fallen.</p>

<p>Two ladies being at <i>Cozone</i>, about 20 miles from <i>Siena</i>, saw
a number of stones fall, with a great noise, in a neighbouring
meadow: one of which, being soon after taken up by a young
woman, burnt her hand: another burnt a countryman's hat:
and a third was said to strike off the branch of a mulberry tree;
and to cause the tree to wither.</p>

<p>Another stone, of about two ounces weight, fell near a girl
watching sheep; a young person, whose veracity it is said
could not be doubted.&mdash;This stone, the Professor tells us, is
also a parallelopiped, with the angles rounded; and its internal
substance is like that of the others; only with more metallic
spots; especially when viewed with a magnifying glass: and
the black external crust appears to be minutely crystallized.</p>

<p>Many others, of a similar kind, were in the possession of different
persons at Siena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>And besides the falling of these from the cloud, there is
described to have been a fall of sand; seen by keepers of cattle
near <i>Cozone</i>, together with the falling of what appeared like
squibs; and which proved afterwards to be stones, of the sort
just described, weighing two or three ounces:&mdash;and some only
a quarter of an ounce.</p>

<p>Amongst other stones that fell; was one weighing two
pounds, and two ounces; which was also an oblong parallelopiped,
with blunted angles, (as they are called, but which I
think meant plainly prismatical terminations, and are said to
have been about an inch in height;) and this was most remarkable
for having, a small circle, or sort of belt round it, in
one part; wherein the black crust appeared more smooth;
and shining like glass; as if that part had suffered a greater
degree of heat than the rest.</p>

<p>Another, also, was no less remarkable, for having many
rounded cavities on its surface: as if the stone had been struck
with small balls, whilst it was forming; and before it was
hardened; which left their impressions.&mdash;And some appearances,
of the same kind, were found on one of the four surfaces
of another stone, in the possession of Soldani.</p>

<p>On minute examination, the Professor found the stones were
composed of blackish <i>crystals</i>, of different kinds; with metallic
or pyritical spots, all united together by a kind of consolidated
ashes.&mdash;And, on polishing them, they appeared to have
a ground of a dark ash colour; intermixed with cubical blackish
crystals, and shining pyritical specks, of a silver and gold colour.</p>

<p>The conclusion which Professor Soldani evidently forms, is;
<i>that the stones were generated in the air, by a combination of
mineral substances, which had risen somewhere or other</i>, <span class="smcap">as exhalations</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i>from the earth</i>: but, as he seems to think, <i>not from</i>
Vesuvius.</p>

<p>The names of many persons, besides those already referred
to, are mentioned; who were eye witnesses to the fall of the
stones. And several <i>depositions</i> were made, <i>in a regular juridical
manner</i>, to ascertain the truth of the facts.</p>

<p>The space of ground, within which the stones fell, was from
three to four miles.</p>

<p>The falling of them, was <i>the very day after</i> the great eruption
of Vesuvius.</p>

<p>And the distance of the place, from Vesuvius, could not be
less than two hundred miles, and seems to have been more.</p>

<p>Vesuvius is situated <i>to the south</i> of the spot: and the cloud
came <i>from the north</i>; about thirteen, or at most eighteen hours,
after the eruption.</p>

<p>Now, putting all these circumstances together, I cannot but
venture to form a conclusion, somewhat different from Professor
Soldani's; though perfectly agreeing with his general
principles.</p>

<p>From a course of observations, and inquiries, which I have
been led to pursue, for a great many years: tending to elucidate
the history of extraneous fossils, and of the deluge; I have
long been convinced, that stones in general, and strata of rocks,
of all kinds, have been formed by <i>two</i> very different operations
of those elements, which the wisdom, and omnipotent hand of
God, has ordained, and created.</p>

<p>The one, by means of fire:&mdash;and the other, by means of
water.</p>

<p>And, of each sort, there are two subdivisions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the stones, and rocks, formed by fire;&mdash;there are some,
(besides lavas,) whose component parts, having been previously
fused, and in a melted state, did merely cool, and
harden <i>gradually</i>.</p>

<p>And there are others; whose component parts, having been
fused, and in a melted state, and having so become completely
liquid; did instantly, by the operation of the powers of <i>attraction</i>,
become crystallized.</p>

<p>And, in like manner; of stones, and of strata of rocks,
formed by means of water;&mdash;there are some, which having
had their component parts brought together, in a fluid state;
did then merely become gradually settled; and by the power
of attraction, and the mixture of crystalline particles, were
hardened by degrees.</p>

<p>And there are others: which, having had their component
parts, in like manner, brought together by water, did yet, on
account of the peculiar nature, and more powerful <i>attraction</i>
of those parts, <i>instantly</i> crystallize.</p>

<p>And both of stones, and of strata of rocks, formed by fire;
and of stones, and of strata of rocks formed by means of
water; there are some such, as have been slowly consolidated
by the first kind of operation; namely by the gradual
cooling or settling of the substances; which yet do contain
imbedded in them, crystals formed by the latter kind of operation.</p>

<p>Instances of which, we seem to have, in some granites, on
the one hand;&mdash;and in some sorts of limestones on the
other.</p>

<p>To this I must add also; that there appear further, to have
been some stones formed <i>by a sort of precipitation</i>: much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
same manner as <i>Grew</i> describes<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> the kernels, and stones of
fruit to have been hardened.</p>

<p>And I have met with many instances, wherein it appears
unquestionably, that all these kind of processes in nature are
going on continually: and that extraneous substances are actually
inclosed, and <i>continually inclosing</i>, which could not be
<i>antediluvian</i>; but must have been recent.</p>

<p>To these short premises, I must beg leave to add; that in
two papers formerly printed in the Philosophical Transactions,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
I endeavoured, by some very remarkable instances, to
prove, that iron, wherever it comes into combination with
any substances that are tending to consolidation, <i>hastens the
process exceedingly</i>;&mdash;and also renders the hardness of the body
much greater.</p>

<p>And I have also endeavoured, elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> to shew, in consequence
of conclusions deduced from experiments of the most
unquestionable authority, that <i>air</i>, in its various shapes and
modifications, is indeed <i>itself</i> the great consolidating fluid, out
of which solid bodies are composed; and by means of which
the various attractions take place, which form all the hard
bodies, and visible substances upon earth.</p>

<p>From all these premises then, it was impossible for me not
to be led to conclude; that we have, in this august phænomenon
of the fall of stones from the clouds, in Tuscany, an obvious
proof, as it were before our eyes, of the combined operation of
those very powers, and processes, to which I have been alluding.</p>

<p>It is well known; that pyrites, which are composed of iron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>and sulphur, and other adventitious matter, when laid in
heaps, and moistened, will take fire.</p>

<p>It is also well known, that a mixture of pyrites of almost
any kind, beaten small, and mixed with iron filings and water,
when buried in the ground will take fire; and produce a sort
of artificial volcano. And, surely then, wherever a vast quantity
of such kind of matter should at any time become mixed
together, as flying dust, or ashes; and be by any means
condensed together, or compressed, the same effect might be
produced, even in the atmosphere and air.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of having recourse to the supposition,
of the cloud in Tuscany having been produced by any other
kind of exhalations from the earth; we may venture to believe,
that an immense cloud of ashes, mixed with pyritical dust,
and with numerous particles of iron, having been projected
from Vesuvius to a most prodigious height, became afterwards
condensed in its descent;&mdash;took fire, both of itself, as well as
by means of the electric fluid it contained;&mdash;produced many
explosions;&mdash;melted the pyritical, and metallic, and argillaceous
particles, of which the ashes were composed;&mdash;and, by
this means, had a sudden crystallization, and consolidation of
those particles taken place, which formed the stones of various
sizes, that fell to the ground: <i>but did not harden the clayey
ashes so rapidly as the metallic particles crystallized</i>; and,
therefore, gave an opportunity for <i>impressions to be made</i> on
the surfaces of some of the stones, as they fell, by means of
the impinging of the others.</p>

<p>Nor does it appear to me, to be any solid objection to this
conclusion, either that Vesuvius was so far distant; or that
the cloud came from the north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>For, if we examine Sir William Hamilton's account of the
very eruption in question,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> we shall find, that he had reason
to conclude, that the <i>pine-like</i> cloud of ashes projected from
Vesuvius, at one part of the time during this eruption, was
twenty-five or thirty miles in height; and, if to this conclusion
we add, not only that some ashes actually were carried to
a greater distance than <i>two hundred miles</i>;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> but that, when
any substance is at a vast height in the atmosphere, a very
small variation of the direction of its course, causes a most
prodigious variation in the extent of the range of ground
where it shall fall; (just as the least variation in the angle,
at the vertex of an <i>isosceles</i> triangle, causes a very great alteration
in the extent of its base;) we may easily perceive, not
only the possibility, but the probability, that the ashes in
question, projected to so vast an height, were first carried
even beyond <i>Siena</i> in Tuscany, northward; and then brought
back, by a contrary current of wind, in the direction in which
they fell.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton himself formed somewhat this sort
of conclusion, on receiving the first intimation of this shower
of stones from the Earl of Bristol.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>I cannot therefore but allow my own conclusion to carry
conviction with it to my own mind; and to send it forth into
the world; as a ground, at least, for speculation, and reflection,
to the minds of others.</p>

<p>That ashes, and sand, and pyritical and sulphureous dust,
mixed with metallic particles from volcanoes; fit for the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>stantaneous
crystallization, and consolidation of such bodies as
we have been describing, are often actually floating in the atmosphere,
at incredible distances from volcanoes, and more
frequently than the world are at all aware of, is manifest from
several well attested facts.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December, 1631, Captain <i>Badily</i>, being in
the Gulph of Volo, in the Archipelago, riding at anchor, about
ten o'clock at night, it began to rain <i>sand</i> and <i>ashes</i>; and continued
to do so till two o'clock the next morning. The ashes
lay about two inches thick on the deck: so that they cast them
overboard just as they had done snow the day before. There
was no wind stirring, when the ashes fell: and yet this extraordinary
shower was not confined merely to the place where
<i>Badily's</i> ship was;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> but, as it appeared afterwards, was extended
so widely to other parts, that ships coming from <i>St.
John d'Acre</i> to that port, being at the distance of <i>one hundred
leagues</i> from thence, were covered with the same sort of ashes.
And no possible account could be given of them, except that
they might come from Vesuvius.</p>

<p>On the 23d of October, 1755, a ship belonging to a merchant
of Leith, bound for Charles Town, in Carolina, being
betwixt Shetland and Iceland, and about twenty-five leagues
distant from the former, and therefore about three hundred
miles from the latter, a shower of dust fell in the night upon
the decks.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>In October, 1762, at <i>Detroit</i>, in America, was a most surprising
darkness, from day-break till four in the afternoon,
during which time some rain falling, brought down, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>drops, sulphur and dirt; which rendered white paper black,
and when burned fizzed like wet gunpowder:<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> and whence
such matter could originally be brought, appeared to be past
all conjecture, unless it came so far off as from the volcano in
Guadaloupe.</p>

<p>Condamine says, the ashes of the volcano of <i>Sangay</i>, in
South America, sometimes pass over the provinces of Maca,
and Quito; and are even carried as far as Guayaquil.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>And Hooke says,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> that on occasion of a great explosion from
a volcano, in the island of Ternata, in the East Indies, there
followed so great a darkness, that the inhabitants could not
see each other the next day: and he justly leads us to infer
what an immense quantity of ashes must, by this means, have
been showered down somewhere on the sea; because at <i>Mindanao</i>,
an hundred miles off, all the land was covered with
ashes a foot thick.</p>

<p>And now, I must add; that such kind of <i>falling of stones
from the clouds</i>, as has been described to have happened in
Tuscany, seems to have happened also in very remote ages, of
which we are not without sufficient testimony; and such as
well deserves to be allowed and considered, on the present occasion;
although the knowledge of the facts was, at first, in
days of ignorance and gross darkness, soon perverted to the
very worst purposes.</p>

<p>In the Acts of the holy Apostles, we read, that the chief magistrate,
at <i>Ephesus</i>, begun his harangue to the people, by
saying, "Ye men of Ephesus, <i>what man is there that knoweth
not how that the City of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the
great goddess Diana, and of the</i> <span class="smcap">image</span> <i>which fell down from
Jupiter</i>?" (or rather, as the original Greek has it) "<i>of</i> <span class="smcap">that</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<i>which fell down from Jupiter</i>?" And the learned <i>Greaves</i>
leads us to conclude this image of Diana to have been nothing
but <i>a conical, or pyramidal stone</i>, that fell from the clouds. For
he tells us,<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> on unquestionable authorities, that many others
of the images of heathen deities were merely such.</p>

<p>Herodian expressly declares,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> that the Ph&oelig;]nicians had no
statue of the sun, polished by hand, to express an image; but
only had a certain <i>great stone, circular below, and ending with
a sharpness above, in the figure of a cone, of black colour. And
they report it to have fallen from heaven, and to be the image of
the sun</i>.</p>

<p>So Tacitus says,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> that at Cyprus, <i>the image of Venus was
not of human shape; but a figure rising continually round, from
a larger bottom to a small top, in conical fashion</i>. And it is to
be remarked, that <i>Maximus Tyrius</i> (who perhaps was a more
accurate mathematician,) says, the stone was <i>pyramidal</i>.</p>

<p>And in Corinth, we are told by <i>Pausanias</i>,<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> that the images
both of <i>Jupiter Melichius</i>, and of <i>Diana</i>, were made (if made
at all by hand) with little or no art. The former being represented
by a pyramid, the latter by a column.</p>

<p><i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i> was so well acquainted with these
facts, that he even concludes<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> the worship of such stones to
have been the first, and earliest idolatry, in the world.</p>

<p>It is hard to conceive how mankind should ever have been
led to so accursed an abomination, as the worship of stocks, and
stones, at all: but, as far as any thing so horrid is to be ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>counted
for, there is no way so likely of rendering a possible
account; as that of concluding, that some of these pyramidal
stones, at least, like the image of <i>Diana</i>, actually did fall, in
the earliest ages, from the clouds; in the same manner as
these pyramidal stones fell, in 1794, in Tuscany.</p>

<p><i>Plutarch</i>, it is well known, mentions<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> a stone which formerly
fell from the clouds, in <i>Thrace</i>, and which <i>Anaxagoras</i>
fancied<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> to have fallen from the sun.</p>

<p>And it is very remarkable, that the old writer, from whom
Plutarch had his account, described the cloud, from which this
stone was said to fall, in a manner (if we only make some allowance
for a little exaggeration in barbarous ages,) very similar
to <i>Soldani's</i> account of the cloud in Tuscany.&mdash;It hovered
about for a long time; seemed to throw out splinters, which
flew about, like wandering stars, before they fell; and at last
it cast down to the earth a stone of extraordinary size.</p>

<p>Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> who tells us that not only the remembrance of this
event, but that the stone itself was preserved to his days, says,
it was of a dark burnt colour. And though he does indeed
speak of it as being of an extravagant weight and size, in
which circumstance perhaps he was misled: yet he mentions
<i>another</i> of a moderate size, which fell in <i>Abydos</i>, and was become
an object of idolatrous worship in that place; as was
still <i>another</i>, of the same sort, at <i>Potidæa</i>.</p>

<p><i>Livy</i>, who like <i>Herodotus</i>, has been oftentimes censured as
too credulous, and as a relater of falsehoods, for preserving traditions
of <i>an extraordinary kind</i>; which, after all, in ages of
more enlarged information, have proved to have been founded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>in truth; describes<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> a fall of stones to have happened on
mount <i>Alba</i>, during the reign of <i>Tullus Hostilius</i>, (that is
about 652 years before the Christian æra), in words that exactly
convey an idea of just such a phænomenon, as this which
has so lately been observed in Tuscany.</p>

<p>He says, the senate were told, that <i>lapidibus pluisse</i>, it had
rained stones. And, when they doubted of the fact; and
sent to inquire; they were assured that stones had actually
fallen; and had fallen just as hail does, which is concreted in
a storm.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>He mentions also shortly another shower of stones,<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> A. C.
202, and still a third,<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> which must have happened about the
year 194 before the Christian æra.</p>

<p>Such are the records of antient history. And in Holy Writ
also a remembrance of similar events is preserved.</p>

<p>For when the royal Psalmist says,<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> "<i>The Lord also thundered
out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones</i>,
<span class="smcap">and coals of fire</span>,"&mdash;the latter expression, in consistency
with common sense, and conformably to the right
meaning of language, cannot but allude to some <i>such</i> phænomenon
as we have been describing. And especially, as in the
cautious translation of the seventy, a Greek word is used,
which decidedly means <i>real hard substances made red hot</i>; and
not mere appearances of fire or flame.</p>

<p>Whilst therefore, with the same sacred writer,<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> we should
be led to consider all these powerful operations, as the works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>of God; <i>Who casteth forth his ice like morsels</i>;<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> and should be
led to consider "<i>fire and hail, snow and vapours, wind and storm
as fulfilling his word</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> we should also be led to perceive, that
the objections to Holy Writ, founded on a supposed <i>impossibility</i>
of the truth of what is written in the book of <i>Joshua</i>,<a name="FNanchor_BB_28" id="FNanchor_BB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_28" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a>
concerning the stones that fell from heaven, on the army of
the Canaanites; are only founded in ignorance, and error.</p>

<p>And much more should we be led to do so; when, to these
observations, and testimonies, concerning showers of hot burning
stones, is added the consideration; that within the short
period of our own lives, incredibly large <i>real hail-stones</i>, formed
of consolidated ice;&mdash;<i>of ice consolidated in the atmosphere</i>,
have fallen both in France, and in England.</p>

<p>In France, on the 13th of July in the year 1788;&mdash;of which
it is well known there has been a printed account: and concerning
which it is said, and has been confirmed, on good authority,
that some of the stones weighed three pounds: whilst
others have been said to weigh even five pounds.</p>

<p>And in England, on the 20th of October, 1791, in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Of one of the hail-stones of this latter, minor storm, I have
had an opportunity of obtaining, by the favour of a friend, an
exact model in glass; whereof I now add an engraving.</p>

<p>This stone fell, with thousands of others of the same kind,
near <i>Menabilly</i>, the seat of <i>Philip Rashleigh</i>, Esq.; well known
for his science, and attention to whatever is curious; who having
great copper works, and many ingenious miners, and workmen,
on his estate, and directly under his eye; caused it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>be instantly picked up: and having then, himself, first traced
both its top, and bottom, upon paper; and having measured
its thickness in every part, with a pair of compasses; caused
a very exact mould to be formed: and afterwards, in that
mould, had this model cast in glass: wherein, also, the appearances
of the imbedded, common, small, roundish hail-stones,
are seen transparently; just as they appeared in the
great hail-stone itself originally.</p>

<p><a href="#ifrontis">Fig. 1,</a> is a representation of the flat bottom of the stone.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, is a representation of the top of the stone.</p>

<p>And fig. 3, shews the whole solid appearance sideways.</p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Rashleigh was taking the measures, it melted
so fast, that he could not, in the end, take the <i>exact weight</i>, as he
fully intended to have done. But as this model in glass weighs
exactly 1 ounce, 16 pennyweights, 23 grains, we may fairly
conclude, that the hail-stone itself weighed much above half
an ounce.</p>

<p>For it is well known, that the specific gravity of common
glass, of which sort this model is made, is to that of water, as
2.620 to 1.000. And the specific gravity of common water, is
to ice, as 8 to 7.<a name="FNanchor_CC_29" id="FNanchor_CC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC_29" class="fnanchor">[CC]</a>&mdash;And computing according to this standard,
I make the exact weight of the hail-stone to have been
295 grains.</p>

<p>From the singular manner in which the small, prior, common
hail-stones appear to have been imbedded in this larger
one, whilst they were falling to the earth; there is reason to
be convinced, that it was formed in the atmosphere, by a sudden
extraordinary congelation <i>almost instantaneously</i>, out of rain
suddenly condensed, which was mingled with the common hail.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>And it was very remarkable, that its dissolution, and melting,
also, was much more rapid than that of the common small
white hail-stones: as was the case, in like manner, with the
other numerous large ones.</p>

<p>Perhaps it ought to be here added:&mdash;that on the 18th of
May, in the year 1680, some hail-stones are recorded to have
fallen in London, near <i>Gresham college</i>, which were seen and
examined by the celebrated <i>Dr. Hooke</i>; and were some of
them not less than two inches over, and others three inches.</p>

<p>This which fell in Cornwall was only about one inch and
three quarters long; an inch, or in some parts an inch and a
quarter broad; and between half an inch, and three quarters
of an inch thick. And its weight was near an ounce.&mdash;How
much more tremendous then were those others, that have been
described as having fallen in France?&mdash;the accounts of some
of them may very probably have been exaggerated: but the
reality was nevertheless as wonderful, surely, as any thing related
concerning the ages of antiquity.</p>

<p>A proneness to credulity is ever blameable. And it is very
possible, that sometimes, in a very wonderful narration, a jest
may be intended to be palmed upon the world, instead of any
elucidation of truth.&mdash;But facts, <i>positively affirmed</i>, should be
hearkened to with patience: and, at least, so far recorded, as to
give an opportunity of verifying whether similar events do afterwards
happen; and of comparing such events one with
another.</p>

<p>To what has been said, therefore, concerning the fall of stones
in Tuscany, and concerning these strange showers of hail, in
France, and in England, it might perhaps too justly be deemed
an unwarrantable omission, on this occasion, not to mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the very strange fact that is affirmed to have happened the last
year, near <i>the Wold Cottage</i> in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>I leave the fact to rest on the support of the testimonies referred
to in the printed paper, which is in so many persons' hands;
and that is given to those who have the curiosity to examine
the stone itself, now exhibiting in London;&mdash;and shall
only relate the substance of the account shortly, as it is given
to us.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 13th of December, 1795, near the
Wold Cottage, noises were heard in the air, by various persons,
like the report of a pistol; or of guns at a distance at sea;
though there was neither any thunder or lightning at the time:&mdash;two
distinct concussions of the earth were said to be perceived:&mdash;and
an hissing noise, was also affirmed to be heard by
other persons, as of something passing through the air;&mdash;and a
labouring man plainly saw (as we are told) that something was
so passing; and beheld a stone, as it seemed, at last, (about ten
yards, or thirty feet, distant from the ground) descending, and
striking into the ground, which flew up all about him: and
in falling, sparks of fire, seemed to fly from it.</p>

<p>Afterwards he went to the place, in company with others;
who had witnessed part of the phænomena, and dug the stone
up from the place, where it was buried about twenty-one
inches deep.</p>

<p>It smelt, (as it is said,) very strongly of sulphur, when it was
dug up: and was even warm, and smoked:&mdash;it was found to
be thirty inches in length, and twenty-eight and a half inches
in breadth. And it weighed fifty-six pounds.</p>

<p>Such is the account.&mdash;I affirm nothing.&mdash;Neither do I pretend
either absolutely to believe: or to disbelieve.&mdash;I have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
an opportunity to examine the whole of the evidence.&mdash;But it
may be examined: and so I leave it to be.</p>

<p>This, however, I will say: that <i>first</i> I saw a fragment of this
stone; which had come into the hands of Sir Charles Blagden,
from the Duke of Leeds: and afterwards I saw the stone itself.&mdash;That
it plainly had a dark, black crust; with several concave
impressions on the outside, which must have been made before
it was quite hardened; just like what is related concerning the
crusts of those stones that fell in Italy.&mdash;That its substance was
not <i>properly</i> of a <i>granite kind</i>, as described in the printed paper;
but a sort of <i>grit stone</i>; composed (somewhat like the stones
said to have fallen in Italy) of sand and ashes.&mdash;That it contained
very many particles, obviously of the appearance of gold,
and silver, and iron; (or rather more truly of <i>pyrites</i>).&mdash;That
there were also several small rusty specks; probably from decomposed
pyrites;&mdash;and some striated marks;&mdash;that it does not
effervesce with acids;&mdash;and that, as far as I have ever seen, or
known, or have been able to obtain any information, no <i>such</i>
stone has ever been found, before this time, in Yorkshire; or in
any part of England. Nor can I easily conceive that such a species
of stone could be formed, by art, to impose upon the public.</p>

<p>Whether, therefore, it might, or might not, possibly be the
effect of ashes flung out from <i>Heckla</i>, and wafted to England;
like those flung out from Vesuvius, and (as I am disposed to believe)
wafted to Tuscany, I have nothing to affirm.</p>

<p>I wish to be understood to preserve mere records, the full authority
for which, deserves to be investigated more and more.</p>

<p>Having, nevertheless, gone so far as to say thus much; I
ought to add, that the memorial of such sort of large stones having
fallen from the clouds is still preserved also in Germany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>For one is recorded to have fallen in <i>Alsace</i>, in the midst of a
storm of hail, November 29th, A. D. 1630;<a name="FNanchor_DD_30" id="FNanchor_DD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_DD_30" class="fnanchor">[DD]</a> which is said to
be preserved in the great church of <i>Anxissem</i>: and to be like
a large dark sort of flint-stone; having its surface operated
upon by fire: and to be of very many pounds weight.</p>

<p>And another is said to be still preserved at Vienna.</p>

<p>This last is described by <i>Abbé Stutz</i>, Assistant in the Imperial
cabinet of curiosities at Vienna, in a book printed in German,
at <i>Leipsyc</i>, in 1790: entitled <i>Bergbaukimde</i> (or <i>the Science of
Mining</i>.)</p>

<p>After describing two other stones, said to have fallen from
the clouds: one in the <i>Eichstedt</i> country in Germany; and
another in the <i>Bechin</i> circle, in Bohemia, in July, 1753; concerning
the <i>real</i> falling of which he had expressed some
doubts; he proceeds to describe the falling of two, (whereof
this was one,) not far from <i>Agram</i>, the capital of <i>Croatia</i>, in
Hungary; which caused him to change his opinion; and to
believe, that the falling of such stones from heaven, was very
possible.</p>

<p>His words, fairly translated,<a name="FNanchor_EE_31" id="FNanchor_EE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE_31" class="fnanchor">[EE]</a> in the beginning of his narrative,
are, "These accounts put me in mind of a mass of iron,
weighing seventy-one pounds, which was sent to the imperial
collection of natural curiosities: about the origin of
which <i>many mouths have been distorted with scoffing laughter</i>.
If, in the <i>Eichstedt</i> specimen, the effects of fire appear <i>tolerably</i>
evident; they are, in this, not to be mistaken.&mdash;Its
surface is full of spherical impressions, like the mass of iron,
which the celebrated <i>Pallas</i> found on the Jenisei river; except
that here the impressions are larger, and less deep; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>wants both the yellow glass, which fills up the hollows of the
<i>Siberian</i> iron; and the <i>sand stone</i>, which is found in the
<i>Eichstedt</i> specimen; the whole mass being solid, compact, and
black, like hammered iron."</p>

<p>And his words in the end of the narrative are,</p>

<p>"There is a great step from the disbelief of tales, to the
finding out the true cause of a phænomenon which appears
wonderful to us. And probably I should have committed the
fault into which we so naturally fall, respecting things we
cannot explain; and have rather denied the whole history,
than have determined to believe any thing <i>so incredible</i>; if
various new writings, on electricity, and thunder, had not
fortunately, at that time come into my hands; concerning
remarkable experiments of reviving <i>metallic calces</i> by the
electric spark. Lightning is an electrical stroke on a large
scale.&mdash;If then the reduction of iron can be obtained, by the
discharge of an electrical machine; why should not this be
accomplished as well, and with much greater effect by the
very powerful discharge of the lightning of the clouds?"</p>

<p>The substance of the account of the fall of stones, in Hungary,
as given by him, after the most accurate inquiries, is
what I shall now add in the following abridged detail; and it
was verified by <i>Wolfgang Kukulyewich, Spiritual vicar of Francis
Baron Clobuschiczky, Bishop of Agram</i>, who caused seven
eye witnesses to be examined, concerning the actual falling of
these stones on the 26th of May, 1751;&mdash;which witnesses were
ready to testify all they affirmed, upon oath,&mdash;and one of them
was Mr. George Marsich, Curate, as we should call him, of
the parish.</p>

<p>According to their accounts; about six o'clock, in the afternoon
of the day just mentioned, there was seen towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
east, a kind of fiery ball; which, after it had burst into two
parts, with a great report, exceeding that of a cannon, fell
from the sky, in the form, and appearance of <i>two chains</i> entangled
in one another:&mdash;and also with a loud noise, as of a
great number of carriages rolled along. And after this a black
smoke appeared; and a part of the ball seemed to fall in an
arable field of one <i>Michael Koturnass</i>; on the fall of which to
the ground a still greater noise was heard; and a shock perceived,
something like an earthquake.</p>

<p>This piece was afterwards soon dug out of the ground; which
had been particularly noted to be plain and level, and ploughed
just before; but where it was now found to have made a great
fissure, or cleft, an ell wide, whilst it singed the earth on the
sides.</p>

<p>The other piece, which fell in a meadow, was also dug up;
and weighed sixteen pounds.</p>

<p>And it is fairly observed, that the unadorned manner in which
the whole account from <i>Agram</i> is written; the agreement of
the different witnesses, who had no reason to accord in a lie;
and the similarity of this history to that of the <i>Eichstedt</i> stone;
makes it at least very probable, that there was indeed something
real, and worth notice, in the account.</p>

<p>The <i>Eichstedt</i> stone (somewhat like that said to have fallen
so lately in Yorkshire) is described as having been composed of
ash-grey sand stone, with fine grains intermixed all through
it, partly of real native iron, and partly of yellowish brown
ochre of iron: and as being about as hard as building stone.&mdash;It
is said not to effervesce with acids, and evidently to consist
of small particles of siliceous stone and iron.&mdash;It had also a
solid malleable coat of native iron, as was supposed, quite free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
from sulphur, and about two lines thick; which quite covered
its surface; resembling a blackish glazing. And the whole
mass exhibited evident marks of having been exposed to fire.</p>

<p>A plain testimony of the falling of this was affirmed to be,
produced as follows; that a labourer, at a brick-kiln, in winter,
when the earth was covered with snow, saw it fall down out of
the air immediately after a violent clap of thunder;&mdash;and that
he instantly ran up to take it out of the snow; but found he
could not do so, on account of its heat; and was obliged therefore
to wait, to let it cool. That it was about half a foot in
diameter; and was entirely covered with a black coat like
iron.<a name="FNanchor_FF_32" id="FNanchor_FF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_FF_32" class="fnanchor">[FF]</a></p>

<p>And I must now add that there is a record;<a name="FNanchor_GG_33" id="FNanchor_GG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_GG_33" class="fnanchor">[GG]</a> that stones, to
the number of some hundreds, did once fall in the neighbourhood
of a place called <i>Abdua</i>; which were very large and
heavy;&mdash;of the colour of rusty iron;&mdash;smooth, and hard;&mdash;and
of a sulphureous smell:&mdash;and which were observed to fall
from a vehement whirlwind; that appeared (like that in Tuscany)
as an atmosphere of fire.</p>

<p>Here I intended to have concluded all my observations. But
a recent publication, which I knew not of, when these sheets
were written, obliges me to add a few more pages.</p>

<p>In a very singular tract, published in 1794, at Riga, by Dr.
<i>Chladni</i>, concerning the supposed origin of the mass of iron
found by Dr. Pallas in Siberia; which the Tartars still affirm
to be <i>an holy thing</i>, and, <i>to have fallen from heaven</i>; and concerning
what have been supposed, by him, to be similar phænomena;
some circumstances are also mentioned, which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>would be an unjust omission not to take notice of shortly, on
the present occasion.</p>

<p>With the author's hypothesis I do not presume to interfere;
but surely his facts, which he affirms in support of his ideas, deserve
much attention; and ought to be inserted, before I conclude
these observations: and the rather, as they were adduced
to maintain conclusions very different from these now offered
to the consideration of the curious.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May, 1676, a fire ball was seen to come from
Dalmatia,<a name="FNanchor_HH_34" id="FNanchor_HH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_HH_34" class="fnanchor">[HH]</a> proceeding over the Adriatic sea; it passed obliquely
over Italy; where an hissing noise was heard; it burst
SSW from Leghorn, with a terrible report; <i>and the pieces are
said to have fallen into the sea</i>, with the same sort of noise, as
when red hot iron is quenched or extinguished in water. Its
height was computed to be not less than thirty-eight Italian
miles; and it is said to have moved with immense velocity.
Its form was oblong, at least as the luminous appearance seemed
in its passage.</p>

<p><i>Avicenna</i> mentions, (Averrhoes, lib. 2do Meteor. cap. 2.)
that he had seen at Cordova, in Spain, a sulphureous stone that
had fallen from heaven.</p>

<p>In <i>Spangenberg</i>'s Chron. Saxon, an account is found, that
at Magdeburg, in A. D. 998, two great stones, fell down in a
storm of thunder: one in the town itself; the other near the
Elbe, in the open country.</p>

<p>The well known, and celebrated <i>Cardan</i>, in his book, <i>De Varietate
Rerum</i>, lib. 14. cap. 72. tells us, that he himself, in
the year 1510, had seen one hundred and twenty stones fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>from heaven; among which one weighed one hundred and
twenty; and another sixty pounds. That they were mostly
of an <i>iron colour</i>, and very hard, and smelt of brimstone. He
remarks, moreover, that about three o'clock, a great fire was
to be seen in the heavens; and that about five o'clock the
stones fell down with a rushing noise.</p>

<p>And <i>Julius Scaliger</i> (in his book <i>De Subtilitate Exerc.</i> p.
333.) affirms, that he had in his possession a piece of iron (as
he calls it,) which had fallen from heaven in <i>Savoy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i> (in <i>Lection. Memorab.</i> Tom. II. p. 911.) mentions a
great triangular stone, described by <i>Sebastian Brandt</i>, (which
seems to have been the identical stone I have already mentioned
as having been preserved in the church of Anxissem,)
and which was said to have fallen from heaven, in the year
1493, at Ensisheim or Ensheim.</p>

<p><i>Muschenbroek</i>,<a name="FNanchor_II_35" id="FNanchor_II_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_II_35" class="fnanchor">[II]</a> speaking of the same stone, says, that the
stone was blackish, weighed about 300lb. and that marks of
fire were to be seen upon it; but apprehended (in which he
seems to have been mistaken) that the date of the fall was 1630.</p>

<p><i>Chladni</i> also mentions another instance (from <i>Nic. Huknanfii</i>
Hist. Hungar. lib. 20. fol. 394.) of five stones, said to have
fallen from heaven at <i>Miscoz</i>, in Transylvania, in a terrible
thunder storm and commotion of the air, which were as big as
a man's head, very heavy, of a pale yellow, and iron, or rusty
colour; and of a strong sulphureous smell; and that four of
them were kept in the treasury room at Vienna.</p>

<p>He adds, (from <i>John Binbard</i>'s Thuring. Chron. p. 193.)
that on the 26th of July, 1581, between one and two o'clock
in the afternoon, a stone fell down in <i>Thuringia</i>, with a clap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>of thunder, which made the earth shake; at which time a
small light cloud was to be seen, the sky being otherwise clear.
It weighed 39lb.; was of a blue and brownish colour. It gave
sparks, when struck with a flint, as steel does. It had sunk
five quarters of an ell deep in the ground; so that the soil, at
the time, was struck up to twice a man's height; and the stone
itself was so hot, that no one could bear to touch it. It is said
to have been afterwards carried to Dresden.</p>

<p>He adds, also, that in the 31st Essay of the Breslau Collections,
p. 44, is found an account by Dr. <i>Rost</i>; that on the 22d
of June, 1723, about two o'clock in the afternoon, in the
country of Pleskowicz, some miles from <i>Reichstadt</i>, in Bohemia,
a small cloud was seen, the sky being otherwise clear;
whereupon, at one place twenty-five, at another eight, great and
small stones fell down, with a loud report, and without any lightning
being perceived. The stones appeared externally black, internally
like a metallic ore, and smelt strongly of brimstone.</p>

<p>And I shall conclude all <i>Chladni</i>'s remarkable facts, in addition
to those which I had myself collected, before ever I
heard of his curious book, with a short summary of what he
calls one of the <i>newest</i> accounts of this kind, extracted from
the <i>Histoire de l'Académie des Sciences</i>, 1769, p. 20.</p>

<p>It is an account of three masses, which fell down with thunder,
in provinces very distant from one another; and which
were sent to the Academy in 1769. They were sent from
<i>Maine</i>, <i>Artois</i>, and <i>Cotentin</i>: and it is affirmed, that when they
fell an hissing was heard; and that they were found hot. All
three were like one another; all three were of the same colour,
and nearly of the same grain; and small metallic and pyritical
particles could be distinguished in them; and, externally, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
three were covered with an hard ferruginous coat: and, on chemical
investigation, they were found to contain iron, and sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_JJ_36" id="FNanchor_JJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_JJ_36" class="fnanchor">[JJ]</a></p>

<p>Considering, then, all these facts so positively affirmed, concerning
these various, most curious phænomena:&mdash;the explosions;&mdash;the
sparks;&mdash;the lights;&mdash;the hissing noises;&mdash;the
stones seen to fall;&mdash;the stones dug up hot, and even smoking;&mdash;and
some scorching, and even burning other bodies in
their passage;&mdash;we cannot but also bring to remembrance, what
Sir John Pringle affirmed to have been observed; concerning a
fiery meteor, seen on Sunday, the 26th of November, 1758,
in several parts of England and Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_KK_37" id="FNanchor_KK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_KK_37" class="fnanchor">[KK]</a></p>

<p>That the head, which appeared about half the diameter of
the moon, was of a bright white, like iron when almost in a
melting heat;<a name="FNanchor_LL_38" id="FNanchor_LL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_LL_38" class="fnanchor">[LL]</a> the tail, which appeared about 8° in length,
was of a duskish red, burst in the atmosphere, when the head
was about 7° above the horizon, and disappeared; and in the
room thereof were seen three bodies like stars, within the
compass of a little more than three degrees from the head,
which also kept descending with the head.</p>

<p>That before this, in another place, near Ancram in Scotland,
(where the same meteor was seen) one-third of the tail, towards
the extremity, appeared <i>to break off</i>, and to separate
into sparks, resembling stars.&mdash;That soon after this the body
of the meteor had its light extinguished, with an explosion;
but, as it seemed to the observer there, <i>the form of the entire
figure of the body, quite black, was seen to go still forwards in
the air</i>.<a name="FNanchor_MM_39" id="FNanchor_MM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_MM_39" class="fnanchor">[MM]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
By some persons, also, an hissing noise<a name="FNanchor_NN_40" id="FNanchor_NN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_NN_40" class="fnanchor">[NN]</a> was apprehended
to be heard.</p>

<p>Whether this might, or might not be an ignited body, of
the kind we have been describing, falling to the earth, deserves
consideration. Sir John Pringle seems to have been
convinced that it was really <i>a solid substance</i>; but fairly adds,<a name="FNanchor_OO_41" id="FNanchor_OO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_OO_41" class="fnanchor">[OO]</a>
that if such meteors had really ever fallen to the earth, there
must have been, long ago, so strong evidence of the fact, as to
leave no room to doubt.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in the preceding accounts, we have such evidence,
<i>now</i> fairly collected together; at least in a certain degree.</p>

<p>I take all the facts, just as I find them affirmed. I have
preserved a faithful and an honest record.</p>

<p>For the sake of possible philosophical use;&mdash;let the philosophical,
and curious just preserve these facts in remembrance.</p>

<p>For the sake of philological advantage;&mdash;let the discerning
weigh, and judge. For (if such things be,) what has so often
come to pass, according to what is commonly called <i>the usual
course of nature</i>; may most undoubtedly, henceforth, without
any hesitating doubts, be believed to have been brought to
pass, on an extraordinary occasion, in a still more tremendous
manner, by the immediate <i>fiat of the Almighty</i>.</p>

<p>Let no man scoff; lest he drives away the means of real information.&mdash;And
let all men <i>watch</i>, for the increase of science.&mdash;</p>

<p>The wisdom and power of God are far above not only
the first apprehensions, but even the highest ideas of man.
And our truest wisdom, and best improvement of knowledge,
consist in searching out, and in attending diligently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>to what he has actually done: ever bearing in mind those
words of the holy Psalmist.<a name="FNanchor_PP_42" id="FNanchor_PP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_PP_42" class="fnanchor">[PP]</a></p>

<p>"<i>The works of The Lord are great: sought out of all them
that have pleasure therein.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The Lord hath so done his marvellous works, that they ought
to be had in remembrance.</i>"</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Since these sheets were printed, I have received from Sir
Charles Blagden, a present of one of the very small stones mentioned,
p. 7, that are affirmed to have fallen in Tuscany; and
which has very lately been brought carefully from Italy.</p>

<p>Its figure plainly indicates, that in the instant of its formation,
there was a strong effort towards crystallization. For it is an
irregular quadrilateral pyramid;&mdash;whose base, an imperfect
kind of square, has two of its adjoining sides about six-tenths
of an inch long, each; and the other two, each about five-tenths:
whilst two of the triangular sides of the pyramid, are
about six-tenths, on every side of each triangle, all of which
are a little curved: and the other two triangular sides, are only
five-tenths on the sides where these two last join.</p>

<p>Its black crust, or coating, is such as has been described in
the preceding pages: and is also remarkable, for the appearance
of a sort of minute chequer work, formed by very fine
white lines on the black surface.</p>
